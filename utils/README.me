## Content

This directory contains all the utility codes for the iEC framework, including original effective connectivity (EC) estimation algorithms.
Readers intereseted in the individual algorithms can refer to the following papers and corresponding repository.

- rDCM: [Regression dynamic causal modeling for resting-state fMRI](https://github.com/translationalneuromodeling/tapas/tree/master/rDCM)
- VAR and GC: [The MVGC multivariate Granger causality toolbox: A new approach to Granger-causal inference](https://github.com/SacklerCentre/MVGC2)
- FASK: [Estimating feedforward and feedback effective connections from fMRI time series: Assessments of statistical methods](http://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad)

Also following toolboxes are used in the current study.

- [Brain Connectivity Toolbox](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/home)
- [Shaded Error Bar Plot](https://github.com/raacampbell/shadedErrorBar)

Hopf model simulation is based on the following study:
